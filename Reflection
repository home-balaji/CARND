You have to show the pipeline implementation on both the videos and please briefly(in the reflection section) describe the current pipeline you used, along-with the shortcomings(situation where the pipeline might fail or factors that might affect the pipeline) and suggestions for improving this algorithm.

Implemented pipeline is pretty standard  

- Convert to gray scale
- Apply gaussian blur
- Create Dr.Yadav filter for Yellow and White Lines
- Apply canny transform
- Merge Canny output with Dr.yadav's filter
- Apply hough Transform which include region of interest
- draw lines only for slopes in the required angles . http://ceng.anadolu.edu.tr/cv/LaneDetection/LaneDetection.htm
- Determine lines for each frame and draw the line - remember worst case scenarios to correct incorrect lines
- Finally combine the lines on top of the original image

Pipeline fails to keep the lower end of the image to the road lines. Changing lanes may fail in the algorithm

Need to improve the algorithm better learning between the images. Currently not enough information getting passed from one frame to other.
